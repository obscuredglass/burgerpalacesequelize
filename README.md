# Welcome to the Burger Palace

## Technologies used
1. HTML
2. JavaScript
3. Node.js
4. MySQL
5. Heroku
6. Sequelize
7. Express
8. Express-Handlebars

This app uses all these different pieces of software so you can order, update, and delete a burger from the menu. It was really interesting to see how all these different pieces of technology flow together to make a seemingly simple website. This is different than the other burger app because it now has the use of Sequelize, which streamlines the use of MySQL.
